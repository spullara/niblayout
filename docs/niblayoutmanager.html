<h1>The NIB Layout Manager</h1>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>The layout managers that are included with Java Swing are either very easy to use, but too simple for real
applications or very difficult to use but can possibly create real applications.  Additionally, the more complicated
layout managers also require reams of code to generate a layout and often require vast refactoring with any
minor change.</p>

<p>The NeXT Interface Builder, now the Apple Interface Builder, upon which this layout manager is based, has
a relatively simple set of constraints along with an excellent tool for drawing the interface. Once an object
is placed, typically using the Apple L&F guidelines as a guide, you can set 6 different connections to either
a strut or a spring.  These are at the North, South,
East, West, Width, and Height axes.  When a component is resized, any axes that has a spring will get its
share of the resized view.  Though it differs from this layout manager in that
it doesn't need to work with different Look&Feels so it is too limited for what we are trying to do.
Requiring absolute positioning relevant for a single L&F was not an option in designing this layout manager.
Also, NIB files were only designed to be built with the IB tool while this layout manager will be equally
useful from the API without a fancy tool to guide you.  One of the things you should note about the Apple
Interface Builder is that it is flexible enough that virtually all applications written for the Mac use
it to generate their user interfaces.  Most platforms do not use the tools they offer their developers for
creating their own applications.  For example, you wouldn't be able to make any of the Microsoft applications with
their GUI development tools, they are all completely custom.</p>

<p>In order to extend the IB model to a programmatic API you need to abstract two features of the tool that are
done visually, the relationship of one component to another and components to their container.  In IB you are
given visual hints as to how far components should be to one another, when they are lining up, and when a component
is the optimal distance from the edges of the container.  These hints are key to making visually appealing interfaces
that match the platform standards.  Additionally, when people are placing the components they generally do so
relative to other components on the surface, i.e. the Cancel button is to the left of the OK button.  In IB, you don't
need to add this layer of indirection, as the user can just place them on the surface that way.  In a programmatic
API you can give them the ability to directly specify these relationships between components.  Also, by specifying
relationships rather than placing components in a grid, you can move blocks of components without disrupting their
visual relationships.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let's build a fairly simple dialog that we would like to be able to resize properly.  We'll give it a username
and password label and field, an OK button, and a Cancel button in standard configuration.  Here is what we
would like the final result to look like:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="400">Normal:</td><td>Resized:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="simple.jpg"/></td><td><img src="simple-resized.jpg"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that in the resized case the buttons have stayed put in the lower right hand corner, the labels have
stayed in the upper left and remain the same size, and the fields themselves are expanding/contracting with the
resize. First we will setup for what we are going to do by creating all the components, this is almost always
about the same no matter what layout manager you are using:</p>

<pre>
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Simple Dialog");
        frame.setSize(320, 150);
        JPanel panel = new JPanel(new NIBLayoutManager());
        JLabel usernameLabel = new JLabel("Username:");
        JTextField usernameField = new JTextField();
        JLabel passwordLabel = new JLabel("Password:");
        JTextField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
        JButton ok = new JButton("OK");
        JButton cancel = new JButton("Cancel");
</pre>

<p>Note that we have set the layout manager of the panel to the NIBLayoutManager.  That is all you have to do
to setup your panel to use it.  The other thing that differs from most of the Swing layout managers is that
for most layouts you need only one panel, even with complex resize mechanics.  This simple layout will not be
an exception to that rule.<p>

<p>We now will generate this user interface using the NIBLayoutManager.  First we place the OK button on the
panel:</p>

<pre>
        panel.add(ok, new NC("nwbr"));
</pre>

<p>The NC class (short for NIBConstraints) is designed to make it possible to be very terse so your code is
not swamped with GUI barf.  This does give you some amount of "line noise" type code, but I've tried to give
you a lot of options for how you actually use the classes.  Let's expand out that line so we can see what it
is doing in detail.  The NC(String springs) constructor takes a string that is a series of boolean flags:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>n</b>: place a spring between this component and north</li>
<li><b>s</b>: south</li>
<li><b>e</b>: east</li>
<li><b>w</b>: west</li>
<li><b>x</b>: place a spring on the width of the component</li>
<li><b>y</b>: height</li>
<li><b>t</b>: initially place the component along the top edge of its container</li>
<li><b>b</b>: bottom</li>
<li><b>l</b>: right</li>
<li><b>r</b>: left</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example we have placed springs between the component and the north and west sides.  That means that
if the container is resized and extra space created/removed will be added/taken from the distance between the
component and the north/west edges.  This will cause the component to stay put relative to the south/east
edges of its container.  Additionally, we have specified that the component will initially be placed in the
bottom right corner of its container. Here is a visual representation of what we have said about the springs
so far:</p>

<img src="simple-springs.jpg"/>

<p>This springs and strut concept is similar to the springs and struts that are included as one of the layout
managers that Swing includes, however, the implementation that they have is quite painful to use from the
API and virtually no one uses it because it basically requires a tool.  The NC contains quite a few shortcuts
and aliases for doing various things, for instance, we could also do this the much more verbose way:</p>

<pre>
        NC nc = new NC();
        nc.n = true;
        nc.w = true;
        nc.b = true;
        nc.r = true;
</pre>

<p>or a more smalltalk like way</p>

<pre>
        NC nc = new NC().n().w().b().r();
</pre>

<p>Later we will see why there are so many aliases.  Some things are easier to use in dynamic languages like
Groovy vs. Java and I am designing this for a wide range of usages. Also, some people prefer terseness and
others would like it spelled out for them.  I am considering whether I should put the terse options in a subclass
and keep all the verbose options in a superclass and let people choose their style that way.  Initial feedback
from some alpha users will probably decide it.  Interestingly, you could always subclass the constraints yourself
and set things up automatically with a wide range of defaults since everything is exposed.</p>

<p>Now lets continue generating the interface.  Next we add the Cancel button:</p>

<pre>
        panel.add(cancel, new NC("nwb").lo(ok));
</pre>

<p>The Cancel button is given the same springs as the OK button so it will stay put relative to the south and
east sides of the container.  Additionally it is placed along the bottom edge of the container and we specify
that initially it will be to the left of the OK button.  Take note that everything specified in the constraints
besides the springs only affect the component for its initial placement on the container.  Those constraints,
like "bottom edge" or "left of" are not reevaluated each time the container is layed out.  The biggest
reason for this is performance of the code during resize, with only the springs affecting the location of the
components there is remarkably little calculation required to determine the new location of components.  The
second reason is that there are a lot of ambiguities introduced if you do allow them all to be reevaluated with
each layout of the container.  This is something that is subject to reconsideration in the future if there is
a good reason for it.  It may at some point be an additional option to leave out springs altogether and simply
use the relative constraints depending on user feedback.  Tool support for "relative only" placement would
also be awkward, but I'm not too worried about that right now.</p>

<p>Those buttons were nearly trivial and that's already a lot easier that doing it in other layout managers.
Let's now look at adding the username label and field:</p>

<pre>
        panel.add(usernameLabel, new NC("setl"));
        panel.add(usernameField, new NC("sxt").awvco(usernameLabel).ro(usernameLabel).eet(panel));
</pre>

<p>Here we put the label in the upper left hand corner and set the springs to south/east.  This is exactly
the opposite of the OK button.  More complicated is the username field itself.  For springs we let the distance
to the south edge expand with vertical resizing and the width of the field change when there is horizontal
resizing.  We then use one of the aliases awvco which stands for "align with vertical center of" to orient it
verticaly even with the label and ro ("right of") the label.  This positions where we want it.  We then eet
("extend east to") the panel edge.  When you use the "extend to" options and you specify a container it uses
the container edges.  When you specify another component in the panel, it will extend to that components edge
initially.  Again, after the initial placement and sizing the springs take care of what happens under when
resized.</p>

<p>Now lets place the final two components, the password label and field, relative to our username label and
field on the panel:</p>

<pre>
        panel.add(passwordLabel, new NC("se").awro(usernameLabel).b(usernameField).swa(usernameLabel));
        panel.add(passwordField, new NC("sxt").b(usernameField).awvco(passwordLabel).ro(passwordLabel).eet(panel));
</pre>

<p>We use a couple of new concepts here, awro ("align with right of") and swa ("same width as").  Because we
don't rely on any sort of grid we must use the "same width/height" operations to ensure that things line up
as we expect them to.  Since preferred sizes are calculated before layout occurs you can forward reference
components that are not yet layed out yet.  In this example, we could have complicated things by using
the more complicated construct mwo ("max width of") and given a set of username label and password label.
This is very useful if you don't know the approximate sizes or the strings will be internationalized and
you don't know which one will be bigger at compile time.  Here is how that would look:</p>

<pre>
        Component[] labels = new Component[] { usernameLabel, passwordLabel };
        panel.add(usernameLabel, new NC("setl").mwo(labels));
        panel.add(passwordLabel, new NC("se").awro(usernameLabel).b(usernameField).mwo(labels));
</pre>

<p>Now lets finish off the program by setting the content pane of the frame and making it visible:</p>

<pre>
        frame.setContentPane(panel);
        frame.setVisible(true);
</pre>

<p>That's all there is to it.  There are tons of options available and they are described in detail in the
javadocs.  Usually a little experimentation is all it takes to figure out whats going on.  Since the API is
so complicated and this is early, you may find that some of the math is wrong or that there are still bugs
in the system.  Please report that to <a href="mailto:sam@sampullara.com">me</a>.</p>

<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>

<h3>Platform Standards</h3>

<p>You'll notice that when you place components there is some amount of space automatically put between
them based on the platform L&F guidelines.  This is similar to what IB does with its placement guides.
Currently I have only implemented these for the Mac L&F, I would love to see what the Windows
guidelines are for the distances between components and between a component and the edge of its
container.</p>

<h3>Baseline</h3>

<p>One of things in IB thats done very well is the ability to line up components with the baseline of the text
contained within the components.  Amazingly, Swing has a very vague grasp on this concept and that makes it
very difficult to do in general.  I have, however, included the ability to line up baselines between JLabels
and JButtons, but other components do not have a baseline to line up with.  I would like to fix this at some
point but need some help from a great Swing wizard to do it.</p>

<h3>Nudges</h3>

<p>Some UIs will invariably need tweaking on some platforms.  In order to enable this, I've added
nudges for the x and y directions that are applied after all other initial placements.  These nudges
should be used within a platform specific framework for exact movement of the components when things
do not line up naturally for some reason.</p>

<h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>

<p>By setting the frame of the component directly you can set the initial location of a component in
absolute terms rather than relative to other components or the edges of the container.  This is
useful when you are building a UI for a particular platform and don't need the benefits of the
relative positioning system.  I discourage the use of this and hope that you give feedback to me
on what further options are needed to get the flexibility that this provides.</p>

<h2>Futures</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add the ability to set minimum sizes for components that imply minimum sizes for their containers.</li>
<li>Still having problems with compound borders.  Single borders seem to work fine.  Investigating.</li>
</ul>
